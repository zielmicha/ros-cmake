===== Ticketed =====

 - cmake/3rdparty/log4cxx-config.cmake no longer needs handholding
  - https://github.com/straszheim/ros-cmake/issues/2
 - cmake/setup.bat.buildspace.in : add boost/cmake dll search paths, something else too(?)
  - not yet added as an issue to troy's ros-cmake, waiting for further modifications

===== Trivial =====

 - cmake/main.cmake : just a patch to turn off the dynamic reconfigure warning.
